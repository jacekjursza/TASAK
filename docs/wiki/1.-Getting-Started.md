# 1. Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the installation and basic usage of TASAK.

## Installation

TASAK is packaged with modern Python standards and can be installed directly using `pip`.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/tasak

# Install the package in editable mode
# This is recommended for development
pip install -e .
```

After installation, the `tasak` command will be available in your shell.

## Verifying the Installation

To verify that TASAK is installed correctly, you can run:

```bash
tasak --help
```

This should display the main help message.

## Your First Configuration

TASAK is useless without a configuration file. Let's create a simple one.

1.  **Create the file:** In the directory where you want to run `tasak`, create a file named `tasak.yaml`.

2.  **Add a `cmd` app:** Add the following content to the file to create a simple `echo` command:

    ```yaml
    apps_config:
      enabled_apps:
        - hello

    hello:
      name: "Hello World"
      type: "cmd"
      meta:
        command: "echo Hello, TASAK!"
    ```

## Running an App

Now you can run your newly defined `hello` app:

```bash
tasak hello
```

The output should be:

```
Hello, TASAK!
```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and configured your first TASAK application.

## App Types

TASAK supports three types of applications:
- **`cmd`**: Simple shell commands
- **`mcp`**: Local MCP servers (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- **`mcp-remote`**: Remote cloud MCP servers (Atlassian, GitHub, Slack) via OAuth
