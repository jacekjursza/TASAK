# 3. Using `cmd` Apps

`cmd` applications are the simplest way to expose functionality through TASAK. They act as a proxy to a shell command.

There are two modes for `cmd` apps: `proxy` and `curated`.

---

## `proxy` Mode (Default)

In `proxy` mode, TASAK simply forwards all arguments it receives to the underlying command. This is useful for wrapping utilities like `git`, `docker`, or `kubectl` where you want to retain the full flexibility of the original command.

### Configuration

```yaml
git:
  name: "Git Proxy"
  type: "cmd"
  meta:
    # The mode is optional, as `proxy` is the default.
    mode: "proxy"

    # The command to execute. Can be a string or a list of strings.
    command: "git"
```

### Usage

With the configuration above, any arguments you pass to `tasak git` will be appended to the `git` command.

```bash
# This will run `git status --short`
tasak git status --short

# This will run `git log --oneline -n 5`
tasak git log --oneline -n 5
```

---

## `curated` Mode

In `curated` mode, you define a structured interface for your command. TASAK will parse the arguments according to your definition and map them to the arguments of the underlying command. This is useful for creating simplified interfaces for complex commands or for providing a more user-friendly experience.

### Configuration

```yaml
docker_build:
  name: "Build Docker Image"
  type: "cmd"
  meta:
    mode: "curated"
    command: "docker build"

    # Define the parameters for the `tasak docker_build` command
    params:
      # This defines a `--tag` argument for tasak
      - name: "--tag"
        # This maps the `--tag` argument to the `-t` argument of `docker build`
        maps_to: "-t"
        required: true
        help: "The tag for the Docker image (e.g., my-app:latest)."

      # This defines a `--path` argument for tasak
      - name: "--path"
        # This maps to a positional argument for `docker build`
        maps_to: "."
        required: false
        default: "."
        help: "Path to the Dockerfile (defaults to current directory)."
```

### Usage

TASAK will automatically generate a help message for your curated command.

```bash
tasak docker_build --help
```

To execute the command:

```bash
# This will run `docker build -t my-app:latest .`
tasak docker_build --tag my-app:latest
```
