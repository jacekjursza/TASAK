# 2. Configuration

TASAK uses a powerful hierarchical configuration system that allows you to define applications globally, locally, or on a per-project basis. All configuration is done in YAML files.

## Configuration Files

TASAK looks for configuration files in the following locations, in this order:

1.  **Global Config:** `~/.tasak/tasak.yaml`
    *   This is the base configuration. Use it for applications that you want to be available everywhere (e.g., system utilities, global tools).

2.  **Local Config (Hierarchical Search):**
    *   TASAK searches for `tasak.yaml` or `.tasak/tasak.yaml` in the current directory.
    *   It then searches in the parent directory, and so on, all the way up to the root of the filesystem.

## Merging Strategy

The configurations are merged using a "last-in-wins" strategy:

1.  The global config is loaded first.
2.  The local configs found during the upward search are loaded, starting from the one closest to the root and ending with the one in the current directory.
3.  If the same key exists in multiple files, the value from the last file loaded will overwrite the previous value.

This allows you to, for example, override a global `git` command with a project-specific one.

## `tasak.yaml` Structure

Here is a reference for the structure of a `tasak.yaml` file:

```yaml
# (Optional) A list of applications to enable.
# If this is not present, all defined apps are considered enabled.
apps_config:
  enabled_apps:
    - my_app_1
    - my_app_2

# --- App Definitions ---

# This is the key you will use to call the app (e.g., `tasak my_app_1`)
my_app_1:
  # (Optional) A human-readable name for the app.
  name: "My First Application"

  # The type of the application. Can be `cmd` or `mcp`.
  type: "cmd"

  # The `meta` block contains the configuration specific to the app type.
  meta:
    # ... see the documentation for cmd and mcp apps for details

my_app_2:
  name: "My Second Application"
  type: "mcp"
  config: "/path/to/mcp/config.json"
```
